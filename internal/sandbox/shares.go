//
// Why each runner needs one: the vz rootfs is re-cloned from the image on
// EVERY boot (see suspendBootRootFS — a per-boot-disposable disk is the
// design), so anything a runner writes under $HOME on the rootfs is gone
// after a plain `clawk down && clawk up`, never mind a destroy. Claude
// survived that because its ~/.claude was mounted from the host; codex's
// sessions, history, and login did not, so every restart looked like a
// fresh install. Persisting each runner's home dir is what makes the
// documented "conversation memory persists across destroys" promise true
// for more than one runner.
//
// Guest paths, all whole-home mounts rather than curated subdir lists —
// the ephemeral parts (caches, logs) measure in hundreds of KB and
// excluding them isn't worth the bookkeeping:
//
//	claude  ~/.claude       projects/, memory/, settings.json, .credentials.json
//	codex   ~/.codex        sessions/, history.jsonl, auth.json, config.toml
//	pi      ~/.pi           agent/{sessions,settings.json,auth.json,trust.json}
//	omp     ~/.omp          agent/sessions/, auth (a fork of pi; it keeps
//	                    pi's PI_CONFIG_DIR contract but uses its own
//	                    home — ~/.pi would mean two runners' state in
//	                    one dir)
//	prime-agent  ~/.prime/agent  sessions/, logs/, auth (also a pi fork;
//	                    its state home is the nested dir, per
//	                    PRIME_AGENT_CODING_AGENT_DIR)
//
// herdr (the terminal workspace manager, not a coding agent) persists its
// config and named sessions under ~/.config/herdr: config.toml,
// sessions/<name>/, and the server/client sockets. Sockets are safe to
// carry across boots — herdr unlinks and rebinds them at start (verified:
// kill -9, stale sockets, clean restart). Its ~/.local/state/herdr is
// deliberately left on the disposable rootfs: a refetchable
// agent-detection manifest cache, same trade as opencode's lock-only
// state dir above.
//
// opencode is the one runner that needs two, because it follows the XDG
// split rather than keeping a single home (verified with `opencode debug
// paths`, which is the authority for its layout):
//
//	opencode  ~/.local/share/opencode  auth.json, mcp-auth.json, opencode.db, repos/
//	opencode  ~/.config/opencode       opencode.jsonc
//
// Its other two XDG dirs are deliberately left on the disposable rootfs.
// ~/.local/state/opencode holds only locks/, and a lock that outlives the
// VM it was taken in is worse than no lock at all — a hard stop would
// leave one behind for the next boot to trip over. ~/.cache/opencode is a
// cache by name and contract; the only real cost is re-downloading
// cache/bin per sandbox, which is the same trade the toolchain caches make
// (see ToolchainCachesEnabled).
//
// Cost note: every entry here is a PCIe device on every sandbox, against
// the ceiling documented in machine/vz (32, with a field-confirmed failure
// at 34). Eight entries plus the workspace, the per-repo aliases, and the
// default capability shares still leaves room for a normal multi-repo
// sandbox, but this list is not free to extend — a runner wanting three
// dirs is where the consolidation trick (one mount plus a dir-override
// env var, e.g. OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR) starts paying for its complexity.

//
// Caches included (well-documented concurrent safety, real payoff):
//
//	Go modules         ~/go/pkg/mod         — file-locked, append-only;
//	                                          standard CI sharing pattern.
//	Cargo registry+git ~/.cargo/registry/{index,cache}, ~/.cargo/git/db
//	                                       — Cargo holds cross-process
//	                                         locks; the same set every

//
// Caches deliberately excluded:
//
//	Go build cache (~/.cache/go-build) — NOT shared. It stays per-VM on
//	  the rootfs (Go's default location). Two reasons: (1) the build
//	  cache is not safe for concurrent builds against one directory
//	  (golang/go#43645) — racing `go build`s in different sandboxes can
//	  delete/move entries mid-read and corrupt each other's lookups,
//	  unlike the append-only, file-locked module cache; (2) it's the
//	  churniest tree we'd share — rewritten on every build — and over
//	  Apple's virtio-fs each guest-cached inode pins a host fd in the VM
//	  XPC process, so it dominated the descriptor blowup we saw. A build
//	  cache is cheap to repopulate per-VM, so the sharing payoff never
//	  justified the hazard.
//	pnpm store / uv cache / Bun cache — all three hardlink from cache
//	  into the working tree (node_modules, .venv). Hardlinks don't
//	  cross filesystems, so on a virtiofs mount these tools silently
//	  fall back to copying — strictly worse than no sharing, since you
//	  pay the copy cost AND lose dedup. Revisit only if worktrees move
//	  onto the same shared mount layout.
//	Cargo target/ — locked per-project; cross-project sharing is an
//	  unimplemented Rust project goal.
//	~/.cargo/bin and ~/.cargo/registry/src — bin/ holds executables,
//	  not cache; src/ is cheap to re-extract from cache/ and sharing
//	  it would just balloon disk usage.
//	Zig and pip — small footprint here; pip is superseded by uv.
