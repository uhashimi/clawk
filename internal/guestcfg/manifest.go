// Package guestcfg defines the boot manifest consumed by clawk-init (the
// injected PID 1 of OCI-image sandboxes) and writes it as a raw config
// disk.
//
// The manifest is plain JSON written directly onto a small block device —
// no filesystem, no ISO. clawk-init json-decodes the device and stops at
// the end of the top-level value, so the zero padding that block-aligns
// the file is never read. It is the guest config channel clawk-init
// reads at boot, and works on both vz and firecracker (virtio-fs, which
// a share-based config channel would need, doesn't exist on firecracker).
//
// The schema here is kept in lock-step with the manifest types inlined in
// internal/agentembed/init_main.go.in — same pattern as vsockproto and
// the agent. Bump Version on breaking changes.

// internal/ninep) — used for the toolchain caches, whose file counts make
// Apple's virtio-fs pin enough host fds to exhaust kern.maxfiles and panic the
// Mac. Tag stays populated as the fallback: an older clawk-init that predates
// 9p support ignores NinePVSockPort (additive field, lenient JSON) and mounts
// the virtio-fs share, and a 9p-capable init falls back to it if the 9p mount
// fails (e.g. a kernel without CONFIG_NET_9P_FD). This keeps the change
// additive — no Version bump, no forced sandbox recreation.
//
// Block selects a third transport, for hosts with no file-sharing transport
// at all: firecracker has neither virtio-fs nor (with the firecracker-CI
// kernel) 9p, so its worktree rides in on its own virtio-blk disk, built on
// the host in userspace (machine/oci.WriteDirDisk). Block is the in-guest
// device path and takes precedence over both other transports; Tag is
